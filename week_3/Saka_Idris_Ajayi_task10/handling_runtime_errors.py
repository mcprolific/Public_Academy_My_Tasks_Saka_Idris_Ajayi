# The keywords used are;

#  - a.`try` – block of code to test for errors.

#  - b. `except` – block of code that runs if an error occurs.

#  - c . `finally` – block of code that always runs (whether error occurs or not).

# LEts have more example on the application of try-except-finally, but try to read in between the line for better understanding.
