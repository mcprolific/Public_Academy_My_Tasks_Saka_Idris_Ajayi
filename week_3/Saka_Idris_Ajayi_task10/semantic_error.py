# 3. Semantic Errors

# - The code runs without crashing, but the output is logically wrong.

# - Hardest to detect because the interpreter sees no error.
# - Semantic errors are mostly logic mistakes, so subtypes are based on how the logic is wrong.
# - Note that semantic errors are not officially exceptions in       Python, but they are real mistakes programmers make when the logic is wrong.

# Common Subtypes of Semantic Errors
#  - Wrong Condition in Logic
#  - Wrong Formula/Computation
#  - Wrong Variable Usage
