# TASK: Build a Quiz Game 

# Requirements:
# Store 20 multiple-choice questions (use a dictionary: {"question": "What is 2+2?", "options": ["A.2", "B.3", "C.4", "D.5"], "answer": "C"}).
# Randomly select 10 questions each time the game runs.
# Give the user 15 seconds per question to answer (if they don't answer in time, mark it wrong).
# Keep score and display result at the end (Correct answers, Wrong answers, Percentage).
# Allow user to retry the quiz without restarting the program.
